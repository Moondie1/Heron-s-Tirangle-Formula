Hello everyone. 
This is my first program that might (not) be useful for someone (who are these ppl) to find the are of a triangle.

How to use: just write first number,then "enter" and so on until three numbers are written.
But there is one condition on which numbers you can write: Each side of the triangle must be less than the addition of two others.

I hope this program will be useful)
